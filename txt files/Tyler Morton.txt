7. Tyler Morton – Midfielder

Starts (Sub): 9 (0)
Goals: 5
Assists: 3

A beneficiary of the promotion of Clarkson and Jake Cain through the ranks, Morton has made continual steps up in responsibility over the past year, and has taken it in his stride.

The 18-year-old was tasked with filling the creative void left by the midfield duo when they left the U18s for the U23s midway through last season, while at the start of this campaign he was stationed as one of Bridge-Wilkinson’s key men.

Now making inroads at U23 level, the silky, intelligent midfielder has continued to impress, making an impact with both goals scored and assists tallied.
