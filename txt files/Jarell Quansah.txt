8. Jarell Quansah – Centre-back

Starts (Sub): 10 (0)
Goals: 1
Assists: 0

With Tom Hill sidelined with a long-term injury and Fidel O’Rourke ‘promoted’ to the role of most-used sub with the U23s, 17-year-old defender Quansah has been stationed as U18s captain.

From Koumetio to Lee Jonas to Terence Miles, the Warrington-born youngster has started alongside a host of different centre-back partners so far, and has maintained a strong level of consistency as Marc Bridge-Wilkinson’s mainstay.

There are shades of Rhys Williams to his game, particularly with the strong tackles, heroic blocks and calm approach in possession that have helped him propel the U18s in their title race.

A brilliant goalline clearance in October’s 4-1 win over Newcastle highlighted his desire and anticipation.
