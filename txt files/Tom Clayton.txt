The U23s currently sit sixth in Premier League 2, but can count their successes by the number of players who have been given senior exposure in a strange campaign, including debuts for Rhys Williams and Billy Koumetio.

Meanwhile, the U18s are in the midst of a title fight in their domestic league, perhaps aided by a decrease in intensity in the schedule without the UEFA Youth League.

At all levels there have been talents to catch the eye, but who have been the 10 best?

Honorary mentions go to Jack Bearne, Luis Longstaff and Owen Beck from the U23s, along with Jakub Ojrzynski, Sean Wilson, Mateusz Musialowski and Max Woltman from the U18s, who have all impressed but not quite made the cut in our list – here’s the 10 who have.

 

10. Tom Clayton – Centre-back / Midfielder

That Clayton is among the young Reds’ top performers despite not playing regularly in his natural role at centre-back is a testament to the 20-year-old’s commitment and team-first attitude.

With Leighton Clarkson earning a three-match suspension in the U23s’ 5-3 win at Man United in September, and then moved up to the first team on a full-time basis, Clayton stepped into the void as Barry Lewtas’ new deep-lying midfielder.

He certainly has a different profile to Clarkson, but the Scotland youth international has given the U23s a strong backbone and a composed outlet in possession, while also stepping up with goals against Arsenal, West Ham and Man City.

One of just three ever-presents for Lewtas’ U23s so far this season.
