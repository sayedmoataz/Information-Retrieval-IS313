Protracted negotiations involving the N.H.L., its board of governors, the players’ union and several moving parts related to municipal, state, provincial and national protocols in two countries culminated Sunday with an agreement for next season.

The 2020-21 N.H.L. regular season will begin Jan. 13 and, if all goes according to plan, end in mid-July after a 56-game regular season and a 16-team, four-round playoff consisting of best-of-seven series featuring the top four teams from each division. The league hopes to return to its regular 82-game schedule next October for the 2021-22 season.

“The National Hockey League looks forward to the opening of our 2020-21 season, especially since the Return to Play in 2019-20 was so successful in crowning a Stanley Cup champion,” the league’s commissioner, Gary Bettman, said in a news release announcing the agreement between the league and the N.H.L. Players’ Association. “While we are well aware of the challenges ahead, as was the case last spring and summer, we are continuing to prioritize the health and safety of our participants and the communities in which we live and play.”

The agreement for the 2020-21 season was a product of the latest round of labor talks and logistical undertakings. After the 2019-20 season was suspended in March, the parties ratified a plan for the playoffs and a collective bargaining agreement that overwrote the existing pact, and extended it through the 2025-26 season.
