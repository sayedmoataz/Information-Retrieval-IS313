9. Conor Bradley – Right-back
Starts (Sub): 11 (1)
Goals: 0
Assists: 2

Bradley’s appearances were limited in his first season with the Reds, but the 2019 signing from Dungannon United clearly made an impression as, having only turned 17 in July, he was cemented as a regular starter for the U23s this season.

And rightly so, the Northern Irishman has been one of Liverpool’s standout young talents throughout the campaign so far, with his strength in defence and persistence in attack making him a key presence at right-back.

Perhaps most impressive was the impact Bradley made over a start and a 12-minute cameo in the EFL Trophy against senior opposition, notching an assist in each outing including an Andy Robertson-like steamroll into the box to tee up Liam Millar against Port Vale.
