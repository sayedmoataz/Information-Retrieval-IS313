Liverpool will assess James Milner and Xherdan Shaqiri’s fitness ahead of the encounter with West Bromwich Albion, but Thiago Alcantara will not come into contention.

The trio were pictured in training at the AXA Training Centre on Wednesday as they close in on returns to action.

Milner and Shaqiri could be considered for the Anfield fixture on Sunday; however, Jürgen Klopp confirmed the Reds will continue to err on the side of caution with Thiago as he works his way back to peak condition having not figured since October 17 due to a knee injury.

Klopp told his pre-match press conference: “Thiago made his first steps back towards team training. He is not involved in the full session but makes good steps and after, unfortunately, the long time he is out now, we cannot and will not rush it.

“The other guys are further, or closer. Shaq trained really good and Millie, yesterday full session, today then a little bit adapted.

“It is a new situation for us; we have still two more training days until we have to make decisions.

“It looks good, but I don’t know. Thiago will not be involved, he has to first be in full training sessions and then we start thinking about it. He is not too far away, I hope.”
